The skills and talents needed for this project are being able to understand what the client wants and to implement them the best you can requiring various skills to do so such as html, css or java script. I belive that the skiils and talents were able to mesh well and I was able to follow through to meet the goals of the client. 

I can see that projects like these could help create change in the area since we are helping others creating better relations between them and Hendrix.

This course has helped me get a better understanding of mainly HTML and CSS. After gaining expirience in markup langauges I think I prefer regular programing like java and would prefer to not challenge things having to do with markup languages.
