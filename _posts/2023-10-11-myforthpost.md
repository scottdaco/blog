I found the easiest parts of this tutorial to be copy and pasting the commands in the terminal. I had various problems though with one command and I fixed it by restating my computer. Not much of it was confusing but it took a while to get the SeedData class to work right. After learning about razor pages through the tutorial, step 2 was much easier. I'm conifident I could create another application of the same complexity.
