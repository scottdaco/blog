I finished the lab with my group on time but forgot to write this post on time. The tutorial was easy since it was just running commands and doing things in the browser then we were able to host the website. The website would ussually work but somtimes it wouldnt because the azure system would find a problem but this usually wouldnt take long for it to fix itself. One of us worked on it and they explained to each member of the group what they were doing.

here is the link to lab10.
