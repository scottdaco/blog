I found this Lab to be somewhat difficult and kept on running into errors which I was able to fix most of them but their are still a few that need to be fixed. Im not very confident with dealing with multiple tables but I am not the one who is in charge of them for my team project so probably wont have to do very much of this type of stuff. Otherwise I am confident about the creation of the other parts of the website.
